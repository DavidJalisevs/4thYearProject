The Singleton pattern, which ensures that only one instance of a particular object or class exists in the game at any given time. 
This could be useful for creating global objects or resources that need to be shared across multiple parts of the game, 
such as a database of player stats or a global leaderboard.

The Observer pattern, which allows objects in the game to subscribe to events or changes in other objects, 
and to be notified when those events or changes occur. This could be useful for creating a system of dynamic events or notifications that 
can alert the player to important developments in the game world,such as the arrival of new aliens.

The Command pattern, which allows players to execute actions or commands in the game using a consistent and predictable interface. 
This could be useful for creating a flexible and extensible system for player input and action, and for allowing player to use 
their superpowers in a variety of different contexts.

The Strategy pattern, which allows players to choose from a variety of different tactics or strategies in the game, 
and to switch between them as needed. This could be useful for creating a system of customizable player builds or loadouts

The State pattern, which allows objects in the game to change their behavior depending on their internal state. 
This could be useful for creating complex and dynamic AI behavior, 
or for allowing player to switch between different superpowers or tactics in combat.
